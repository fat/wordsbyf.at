Last April [@voodootikigod](https://twitter.com/voodootikigod) invited me out to Scottsdale, Arizona to speak at [JSConf](http://2012.jsconf.us). The whole experience was crazy amazing and if you've never gone - be sure to go next year!

At any rate, if you missed my talk, I've finally found the time to post it below and it's definitely worth a watch. If for no reason other than seeing [@janl](https://twitter.com/voodootikigod) and I hug it out on stage.
