title: "I don't write \"JavaScript\""

I've been getting [asked](https://twitter.com/#!/nmosafi/status/129946172860268544) and even [hassled](https://twitter.com/#!/pamelafox/status/128718640467021824) on the absence of semicolons in bootstraps js source quite a bit lately. This sorta surprised me. So much in fact i had to create a blog to write about it. :D

Despite what you may have heard, you have options when you write js. **LOTS** of options. It's pretty neat. Consider this simple bit of code:

    if (event.preventDefault) {
      event.preventDefault()
    }

Pretty straight forward. However, the brackets are optional, and this could be rewritten to look something like this:

    if (event.preventDefault) event.preventDefault()

If you were really having fun with it you could lose the if all together and do something like this:

    event.preventDefault && event.preventDefault()

Each is perfectly valid. Each behaves the same. It's just a matter of style.

With a syntax as relaxed as javascript's, you see lots of different approaches to the same problem. From this, it's easy to encounter one particularly frightening approach and immediately recoil into a prescriptive discourse.

When someone tells me I "should" put brackets there or I "should" put a semicolon here, it almost always stems from one bad experience or worse, a book by <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">some old guy</a>.

If you're really interested in the technical details as to why it's ok to exclude semicolons, i highly read this [excellent letter](http://blog.izs.me/post/2353458699/an-open-letter-to-javascript-leaders-regarding) written by [@izs](//twitter.com/izs).

### Why are there no semicolons in bootstrap?

Technically there are semicolons in bootstrap. But they're only present where necessary.

The only semicolon which is present in any boostrap js file, which could be excluded is the one found directly at the end of the file.

This was added for developers who were concatenating bootstrap js with rails files written with this rather unfortunate, but highly pervasive pattern:

```js
(function () {

}())
```

You've probably seen it before, or even used it. I ask you to stop.
