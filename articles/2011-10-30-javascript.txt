title: "\"javascript\""

I've been getting [asked](https://twitter.com/#!/nmosafi/status/129946172860268544) and even [hassled](https://twitter.com/#!/pamelafox/status/128718640467021824) on the absence of semicolons in bootstraps js source quite a bit lately. This sorta surprised me.

You have options when you write js. **LOTS** of options. It's pretty neat. Consider this simple bit of code:

```js
if (event.preventDefault) {
  event.preventDefault()
}
```

This could be rewritten with out the brackets like this:

```js
if (event.preventDefault) event.preventDefault()
```

Or even without the `if` like this:

```js
event.preventDefault && event.preventDefault()
```
Each is perfectly valid. Each behaves the same. It's just a matter of style.

With a syntax as relaxed as javascript's, you see lots of different approaches to the same problem. From this, it's easy to encounter one particularly frightening approach and immediately recoil into a prescriptive discourse.

When someone tells me I "should" put brackets there or I "should" put a semicolon here, it almost always stems from one bad experience or worse, a book by <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">some old guy</a>.

If you're really interested in the technical details as to why it's ok to exclude semicolons, i highly read this [excellent letter](http://blog.izs.me/post/2353458699/an-open-letter-to-javascript-leaders-regarding) written by [@izs](//twitter.com/izs).

### Why are there no semicolons in bootstrap?

Technically there are semicolons in bootstrap. But they're only present where necessary.

The only semicolon which is present in any boostrap js file, which could be excluded is the one found directly at the end of the file.

This was added for developers who were concatenating bootstrap js with rails files written with this rather unfortunate, but highly pervasive pattern:

```js
(function () {

}())
```

You've probably seen it before, or even used it. I ask you to stop.
