It's sunday. And this is my blog. It's new. And this is a post. It's the first one.

I'm going to write words about javascript here. Sometimes i'll post pictures as well.

I work at twitter on the platform team. This means I put twitter on websites. That means i'm responsible for that tweet button over there.

I've done some <a href="//github.com/fat">opensource stuff.</a> <a href="//ender.no.de">Ender</a> and <a href="//twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Boostrap</a>.

I'm not a computer scientist. I have a degree in literature. I don't read. I do perform computer science.

I'm not obese, but I will respond to fat.

I'm hungover. I'm eating pizza.

I do comma first. I do declare my variables at the top of my functions.

I don't do semicolons. I don't do Crockford.

Hopefully that all makes sense. Hopefully you find this useful.
